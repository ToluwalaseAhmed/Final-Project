## About the Project

For our final project, we decided to look at each neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh in order to find the best neighborhood. Specifically, we focused our research on the amount of crime, 311 calls and PLI violations that were reported/found. Our datasets listed different instances of these reports being filed with the neighborhood that each were located in. Using this information, we counted the amount of times a neighborhood was associated with these reports.
